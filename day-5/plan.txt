create vectors for each row of data
> use vector.begin() to get the latest value on the top (use this to find answer too)


reading value (done)
> split the data into two parts: crates / instructions [vector<string>]
> for the crates vector, remove all other characters except for alphabets 
> first loop through all elements in the crates vector and if they are an alphabet, push it to another vector (final one)

reading the instructions
> in the instructionsIndex vector, the last 2 are always the rows, and the rest in front are the number of crates to be moved
> loop through the numbers.
